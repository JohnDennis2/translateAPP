Translate App User Story

As a user,
I WANT an app that will translate sentences from one language to another
SO THAT I can understand what others are saying in a different language.


Given a Translation App,
When I open the app,
Then I am presented with 2 sections, one for user input and one for translated results.
When I enter input into the translate section and click translate,
Then I am displayed a translated output in the translated section.
After I input into the translate section, I can choose a translation language from a drop down, or opt to randomize,
Then my translation is output inside the translated section.
When I hit the translate button, 
Then the results will be saved in a recently-translated section at the bottom of the page, saved to local storage, and then displayed.
