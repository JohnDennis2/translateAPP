## User Story

As a user,
I WANT an app that will translate sentences from one language to another
SO THAT I can understand what others are saying in a different language.


Given a Translation App,
When I open the app,
Then I am presented with 2 sections, one for user input and one for translated results.
When I enter input into the translate section and click translate,
Then I am displayed a translated output in the translated section.
After I input into the translate section, I can choose a translation language from a drop down, or opt to randomize,
Then my translation is output inside the translated section.
When I hit the translate button, 
Then the results will be saved in a recently-translated section at the bottom of the page, saved to local storage, and then displayed.


## Project Description
This application is a translation app where the user can input a word or phrase, and have it translated to one of over 200 languages. Fully developed from scratch, it utilizes multiple
HTML files of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It also utilizes technologies such as API calls to return information from 3rd party APIs, localStorage to store previously translated phrases
onto a seperate web page, and finally, it was stylized using Bulma.
